# Duncan's Portfolio

This project was built in React. I designed all elements and the website layout in Adobe Illustrator and animated them in Adobe After Effects.

## Project Highlights

• Native / custom built React hooks

• Intersection observers to trigger css transitions

• Lottie / SVG animation

• Platform detection & adaptability (snap-scroll enabled on desktop, sections resized on mobile)

• DOM manipulation with jQuery
